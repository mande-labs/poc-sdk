# Proof of Credibility (POC) SDK

The Proof of Credibility (POC) SDK is a comprehensive framework designed for decentralized applications (dApps) to build and manage reputation systems efficiently. Utilizing Mande L2 chain, the SDK leverages the flexibility and security of smart contracts to provide robust reputation management solutions.

## Features

- **Modular Design**: Adheres to the Diamond standard (ERC-2535) for smart contract modularity, allowing dynamic addition and removal of functionalities.

- **Comprehensive Reputation Management**: Enables dApps to implement sophisticated reputation systems, enhancing trust and credibility in decentralized environments.

- **Flexible Integration**: Designed for ease of use with various blockchain-based applications and services.

- **Scalable and Upgradable**: Thanks to the Diamond standard, the SDK is highly scalable and can be upgraded without disrupting the existing ecosystem.

## Installation

To install the POC SDK, use npm:

```bash

npm install poc-sdk

```

Or, if you prefer using yarn:

```bash

yarn add poc-sdk

```

## Quick Start

Here's a quick guide to get started with the POC SDK:

### Initialize the SDK

```typescript

import { POC } from 'poc-sdk';

const poc = new POC();

```

### Add Modules

```typescript

// Example of adding a zk (Zero-Knowledge) module

const zkModule = new ZKModule();

poc.addModule('zk', zkModule);

// Add more modules as needed

```

### Use Modules

```typescript

const zk = poc.getModule('zk') as IZKModule;

// Use the zk module methods as required

```
